# **Youtube earnings prediction project**
---
## **Problem Statement**
---
The success of content creators on YouTube is often associated with various factors such as the number of views, engagement metrics, and the audience's demographics. This project seeks to develop a predictive model that estimates a YouTuber's earnings based on key performance indicators and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide content creators and stakeholders with a tool that offers insights into potential earnings, aiding in strategic decision-making and content optimization.

## **Main Objective**

Develop a robust and accurate linear regression model to predict average YouTube earnings for content creators, leveraging key performance indicators and relevant factors, in order to empower content creators with actionable insights for optimizing their content strategy and maximizing revenue on the YouTube platform.

### Specific Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Pre-Processing:** Perform EDA on the data to better understand the dataset. Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data inconsistencies.
2. **Model Development:** Apply linear regression modeling techniques to establish a relationship between the chosen independent variables and YouTube earnings.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify and select the most significant independent variables that have a significant impact on earnings. 
4. **Assess Model Perfomance:** Estimate and Interprate the co-efficient of the significant predictor variables
5. **Interpretation of Results:** Interpret the coefficients of the regression model to understand the relative importance of each independent variable in predicting YouTube earnings. Provide insights into the factors that most strongly influence earnings.
